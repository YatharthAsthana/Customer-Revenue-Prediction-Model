# Customer-Revenue-Prediction-Model
The "Customer Revenue Prediction" project aims to detect if a customer will purchase an item. It provides insights into customer behavior and product performance using a deep learning model with dense layers and various activation functions.
In this project, I developed a predictive model to analyze e-commerce data and forecast customer revenue generation. The dataset included diverse features like browsing behavior, product interaction, bounce rates, special days, and visitor types. The goal was to identify patterns in user behavior and accurately predict whether a visitor would generate revenue.
I began by performing extensive Exploratory Data Analytics to clean, preprocess, and visualize the data. Features such as bounce rate, exit rate, and page value were particularly insightful in capturing customer intent. I addressed class imbalance by incorporating techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and fine-tuning model performance using cross-validation. For model development, I started with a Sequential model using the TensorFlow Keras library. I designed a multi-layer neural network with Rectified Liner Unit (ReLU) activation for hidden layers and a softmax function for the output layer. Despite achieving an initial accuracy of 84%, I realized there was room for improvement.
To enhance performance, I implemented polynomial feature transformation to capture complex feature interactions and improve model expressiveness. This significantly increased accuracy to 89%. Additionally, I explored ensemble learning techniques by combining Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM in a voting classifier with soft voting. This further improved the F1 score, especially for the minority class, while achieving a final accuracy of 91%. Hyperparameter tuning played a crucial role in achieving these results. Using Grid Search and Random Search, I optimized parameters like learning rate, number of hidden units, and ensemble weights. I used metrics like F1 score, precision, and recall to ensure balanced performance, especially for the minority class. 
The final model provides actionable insights for businesses by identifying high-revenue generating customers and optimizing marketing strategies.
